        "category": "SaaS / Full Stack",
        "description": "All-in-One SaaS platform for psychology practice management, integrating scheduling, medical records, and financial control.",
        "challenge_text": "Managing a solo practice suffers from fragmentation: scheduling via WhatsApp, finances in spreadsheets, and paper records. The challenge was to create a unified digital experience simple enough not to burden the workflow, yet robust enough to automate the financial cycle and offer patient autonomy.",
        "development_text": "The priority was building a reactive, user-friendly interface, allowing the psychologist to focus on what matters: patient care. At the system's core, I designed a context segregation architecture that rigorously isolates the patient self-service portal from the clinical environment, ensuring absolute record privacy without sacrificing usability.",
        "result_text": "The platform professionalized the clinical operation. The Patient Portal drastically reduced messaging back-and-forth for scheduling, while the financial module automated receipt issuance and cash flow control, giving back precious time for the main focus: patient care."

        "description": "Advanced telemetry and experiment management system for automotive engineering, in partnership with Renault and Horse.",
        "challenge_text": "The challenge was creating an Edge-to-Cloud data pipeline robust enough to support critical data acquisition from moving vehicles via 5G. It was necessary to orchestrate remote embedded hardware configuration and ensure high-frequency file integrity, all while managing a complex infrastructure with multiple interdependent services.",
        "development_text": "The solution required precise orchestration between services to ensure data integrity coming from the board. I developed control logic to synchronize high-frequency packet reception with disk persistence, avoiding I/O bottlenecks. On the frontend, the challenge was building a reactive state architecture capable of rendering high-density charts without freezing, allowing users to fluidly switch between live fleet monitoring and analyzing experiment reports.",
        "result_text": "We transformed the test vehicle into a connected lab. The solution eliminated the physical barrier of field testing, allowing teams to configure experiments and analyze critical telemetry in real-time, drastically reducing the feedback loop between the test track and the R&D lab."

        "title": "Franchise Ecosystem",
        "category": "ERP / HealthTech",
        "description": "Comprehensive solution for dental franchise network management, unifying clinical, financial, and administrative operations.",
        "challenge_text": "The scenario was fragmentation. With multiple franchises operating in silos, the network suffered from a lack of standardization and difficulty extracting intelligence from consolidated data. The technical challenge was architecting a multi-tenant system capable of managing everything from a clinic's micro-inventory to the entire network's macro-performance indicators, without sacrificing performance.",
        "development_text": "Over a year of continuous evolution, we built a modular platform. The backend acts as a robust backbone ensuring fiscal and contractual integrity, while the frontend delivers information-dense interfaces—like interactive dental charts and dynamic schedules—without losing fluidity. The complexity of disparate modules (Chat, Finance, IoT Inventory) was abstracted into a unified end-user experience.",
        "result_text": "The system became the network's central nervous system. Centralization eliminated operational bottlenecks, enabling managers to make real-time data-driven decisions and dentists to focus on patients, with the entire administrative flow automated, from scheduling to invoicing."

        "category": "CRM / EdTech",
        "description": "Centralized operational management platform, unifying CRM, cash flow, and hybrid product sales (physical and digital).",
        "challenge_text": "Company expansion created operational chaos: managing hybrid revenue (in-person tickets and digital sales) on isolated platforms generated a financial blind spot and prevented the CRM from having a single customer view, in addition to higher costs. The technical challenge was replacing the patchwork of spreadsheets and external gateways with a robust operational core, where cash flow integrity was priority zero, regardless of the product type sold.",
        "development_text": "I developed a finance-centric architecture. Unlike common platforms, here every sale (whether a course or a ticket) starts primarily as a financial transaction reconciled with the payment gateway, ensuring cash flow integrity. On top of this core, I coupled delivery modules: a video player for e-learning, a code validator for in-person events, and a dynamic headless Landing Page where marketing updates content without deployments.",
        "result_text": "The solution eliminated the need for 4 distinct SaaS tools. Today, the platform manages the full customer lifecycle: from capture on the Landing Page, through purchase integrated with Asaas, to content consumption or event check-in, with all financial data instantly reflecting in the administrative dashboard."
