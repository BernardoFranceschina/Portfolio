challenge_text: "Managing a solo practice suffers from fragmentation: scheduling via WhatsApp, finances in spreadsheets, and paper records. The challenge was to create a unified digital experience simple enough not to burden the workflow, yet robust enough to automate the financial cycle and offer patient autonomy."
development_text: "The priority was building a reactive, user-friendly interface, allowing the psychologist to focus on what matters: patient care. At the system's core, I designed a context segregation architecture that rigorously isolates the patient self-service portal from the clinical environment, ensuring absolute record privacy without sacrificing usability."
result_text: "The platform professionalized the clinical operation. The Patient Portal drastically reduced messaging back-and-forth for scheduling, while the financial module automated receipt issuance and cash flow control, giving back precious time for the main focus: patient care."
