challenge_text: "Company expansion created operational chaos: managing hybrid revenue (in-person tickets and digital sales) on isolated platforms generated a financial blind spot and prevented the CRM from having a single customer view, in addition to higher costs. The technical challenge was replacing the patchwork of spreadsheets and external gateways with a robust operational core, where cash flow integrity was priority zero, regardless of the product type sold."
development_text: "I developed a finance-centric architecture. Unlike common platforms, here every sale (whether a course or a ticket) starts primarily as a financial transaction reconciled with the payment gateway, ensuring cash flow integrity. On top of this core, I coupled delivery modules: a video player for e-learning, a code validator for in-person events, and a dynamic headless Landing Page where marketing updates content without deployments."
result_text: "The solution eliminated the need for 4 distinct SaaS tools. Today, the platform manages the full customer lifecycle: from capture on the Landing Page, through purchase integrated with Asaas, to content consumption or event check-in, with all financial data instantly reflecting in the administrative dashboard."
